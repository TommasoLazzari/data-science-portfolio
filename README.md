# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of my data science projects. Each project is self-contained in its own subfolder and includes code, data, and documentation.

## Projects

- **Portfolio Optimization and Efficiency Testing: An Empirical Study on EuroStoxx 600 Stocks (2024)**
  - Description: Optimization of portfolios using statistical and financial models on real market data.
  - [View Project](./PortfolioOptimization_EfficiencyTesting/README.md)

- **Modeling and Forecasting Volatility of Financial Returns: A GARCH Analysis of Starbucks and Walmart (2024)**
  - Description: Analysis and forecasting of financial market volatility using GARCH-family models. The study compares different model specifications (GARCH, EGARCH, APARCH) and innovation distributions (normal, Student-t), with performance validated through Diebold-Mariano tests and rolling correlations.

- **Gradient and Coordinate Descent Methods: Theory, Implementation, and Experimental Insights (2025)**
  - Description: Comparative analysis of gradient-based optimization methods (fixed step, Armijo rule, block coordinate descent, coordinate minimization) on synthetic and real data.  
  - [View Project](./Gradient_and_CoordinateDescentMethods/README.md)
    

- **FIRST ORDER OPTIMIZATION METHODS: a Comparative Analysis of the Projected Gradient Method and the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm on Portfolio Optimization (2025)**
  - Description: Comparative analysis of the performances of the Porjected Gradient Method and the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm (and variants) on the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Problem.
