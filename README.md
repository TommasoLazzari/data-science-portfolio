# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of my data science projects. Each project is self-contained in its own subfolder and includes code, data, and documentation.

## Projects

- **Portfolio Optimization with EuroStoxx 600 (2024)**
  - Description: Optimization of portfolios using statistical and financial models on real market data.
  - [View Project](./portfolio-optimization/README.md)

- **Volatility Modeling with GARCH: Starbucks and Walmart (2024)**
  - Description: Analysis and forecasting of financial market volatility using GARCH-family models. The study compares different model specifications (GARCH, EGARCH, APARCH) and innovation distributions (normal, Student-t), with performance validated through Diebold-Mariano tests and rolling correlations.

- **Gradient Descent Methods for Semi-Supervised Learning (2025)**
  - Description: Comparative analysis of gradient-based optimization methods (fixed step, Armijo rule, block coordinate descent, coordinate minimization) on synthetic and real data within a semi-supervised learning framework.
